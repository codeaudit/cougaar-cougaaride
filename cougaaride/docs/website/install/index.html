<h1>Installing CougaarIDE</h1>
<p><b>NOTE:</b><br>
As CougaarIDE is comprised of a number of Plugins for Eclipse, you will
need to install the Eclipse SDK before attempting to run CougaarIDE.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Step 1: Obtain a CougaarIDE Distribution</h3>
You can <a href="../build/index.html">build a distribution of
CougaarIDE from source</a>, or you can download a binary file release
from <a href="http://cougaar.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=19">Cougaar
Forge</a>.<br>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Step 2: Unzip the CougaarIDE Distribution</h3>
Use a Zip-compatible program to unzip the distribution to the directory
you installed Eclipse into.<br>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> The distribution contains an "eclipse" directory with
"plugins" and "features" sub-directories. You must unzip into the
directory that contains "eclipse" for your install. (e.g. "C:\ Program
Files").
<p></p>
<h3>Step 3: Restart Eclipse</h3>
You should be prompted to OK the installation of the CougaarIDE feature
and its plugins; say ok.<br>
<h3>Step 4: Verify the Feature is installed</h3>
Click the Help menu, and select "About Eclipse Platorm".&nbsp; You
should see the Cougaar IDE feature icon, and if you click on it, you
should be able to see all the plugins installed by it.<br>
