<H1>Installing CougaarIDE</H1>
<P><B>NOTE:</B><BR>
As CougaarIDE is comprised of a number of Plugins for Eclipse, you will need to install the Eclipse SDK before attempting to run CougaarIDE.
</P>


<P>
<H3>Step 1: Obtain a CougaarIDE Distribution</H3>
CougaarIDE is currently only available from CVS, although file releases are expected soon from <A HREF="http://cougaar.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=19">Cougaar Forge</A>.<BR>
In order to obtain a distribution, you must <A HREF="../build/index.html">build a distribution of CougaarIDE from source</A>.


<P>
<H3>Step 2: Unzip the CougaarIDE Distribution</H3>
Use a Zip-compatible program to unzip the distribution to the directory you installed Eclipse into.<br>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B> The distribution contains an "eclipse" directory with "plugins" and "features" sub-directories. You must unzip into the directory that contains "eclipse" for your install.  (e.g. "C:\ Program Files").
</P>


<P>
<H3>Step 3: Restart Eclipse</H3>
You should be prompted to OK the installation of the CougaarIDE feature and its plugins; say ok.
