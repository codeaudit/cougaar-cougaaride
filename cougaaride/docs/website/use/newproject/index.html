<br>
<br>
Select<span style="font-weight: bold;"> File-&gt;New-&gt;Project </span>from
the Eclipse workbench. This will launch the new project wizard
selection page.<br>
<img style="width: 500px; height: 500px;" alt="new project" title=""
 src="../../images/new_project_main.jpg"><br>
<br>
Select the "Cougaar Wizards" on the right and then select the "New
Cougaar Project" option then press &#8216;Next&#8217;.<br>
This will present you with a page that allows you to set the Cougaar
installation you want to use for the new project.<br>

<br>
Select the version you want to use from the drop down list, or press
the "New Cougaar Installation" button, if you haven't configured the
version you want to use yet (if you create a new one, you can follow
the directions on <a href="../installations/index.html">managing
Cougaar installations</a> for this step), then press "Next".<br>
This will take you to a page that lets you&nbsp; enter
a project name and select the location to store the project.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>If you already have existing source (that is
not already <span class="GramE">a</span> Eclipse project), you use the
project
contents option to load existing source and folders.<br>

<br>
Click Next when Complete.<br>
The next series of tabs are exactly the same as a standard
Java project in Eclipse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You do <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">NOT </span>need
to set up your <span class="SpellE">Classpath</span> at this time for
the
standard Cougaar jars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This will be
handled by CougaarIDE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You do, however,
need to add any third party jars not part of the normal Cougaar project.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When you have finished setting up these tabs
click Finish.<br>
<img style="width: 500px; height: 501px;"

<br>
This will attempt to build the project and add it to your
workspace.&nbsp; If you are not in the Cougaar Perspective, you will be
asked to switch to it.<br>
